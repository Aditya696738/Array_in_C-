Introduction
Arrays are one of the essential data structures in C++. They offer a way to store multiple elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations, making them well-suited for tasks where you need efficient, ordered storage and quick access to elements. In this repository, youâ€™ll find several sample programs that demonstrate:
How to declare, initialize, and access arrays.
Traversing arrays using loops.
Performing search and insertion operations.
Handling multi-dimensional arrays where applicable.

Clone the repository:
bash

git clone https://github.com/Aditya696738/Array_in_C++.git
